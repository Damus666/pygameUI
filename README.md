# pygameUI

Library based on pygame that lets you create a clean and interactive interface for your game/applications using simple to understand elements
I took inspiration from "pygame_gui" (https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui)
Can be included in any pygame project by pasting the code.
I did not publish it to git but you can paste this in your "site-packages" folder
